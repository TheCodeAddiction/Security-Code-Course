# About
This is a bunch of tasks used for a coding course for a group of security people
that have little, but some exsperiance with coding. 

The tasks are "security themed" without having a requirement for infrastructure, such as VMS etc.

The task included are:
1. A starting task for a "Find the spy" type game, where you are suppose to search through
an access log to find who has entered twice the same day.
2. a crt.sh parser to grab a bunch of sub domains for a given domain
3. a DNS loopup tool that automates DNS lookup requests and writes different information
to different files.

# Learning Approch
The first program,  "find the spy" should be used as a "code together" with the
teacher, after an introduction to "how to think like a programmer". 

The other tasks, the students should try to solve themselves, working in groups and with
the teacher helping out. I advice starting with crt.sh as it is simpler than DNS lookup.
